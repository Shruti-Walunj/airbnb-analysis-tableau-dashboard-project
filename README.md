# 📊 Airbnb Market Analysis Dashboard Using Tableau

# 📝 Description:
Built a Tableau dashboard to help a potential Airbnb investor decide where to buy property, how to price it, and when to list it—using real-world Seattle Airbnb data from Kaggle.

# 🛠️ Key Tasks:
Cleaned and combined two large datasets: listings (3818 rows, 92 columns) and calendar (1M+ rows)

Joined datasets to analyze price trends across location, time, and property features

Created 5 visualizations: price by zipcode, interactive map, revenue by week, average price per bedroom, and bedroom listing count

Designed an interactive, insight-rich dashboard for strategic property investment

# 📊 Insights:
Zipcode 98134 had the highest avg price ($206.6), 98125 the lowest ($64.7)

June is the peak revenue month; January is the lowest

More bedrooms = higher prices (1-bedroom ~$96, 6-bedroom ~$585)

Most listings are 1-bedroom (1811), while larger listings face less competition
